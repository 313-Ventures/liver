ok for the sample name: i.e. TCGA-UB-A7MB-01A-01-TS1 
the patient ID corresponds to A7MB. 
Next, 01A should be also considered: 
    the letter (A, B, C, D....) refers to the ID of the tubes 
    (one sample can have multiple tubes i.e. multiple prelevements) . 
    the number refers to the tissue type: 
        01 for solid primary tumor, 
        06 for metastasis see here

but we need actually to consider only the 01 tubes
for the model
so please discard the other samples for now

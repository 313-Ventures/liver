Hi Fred, 

will you be available tomorrow by chance (starting at 9:00am) to have a talk? I have few slides I want to show you. I think your ideas are really a good start.

To be more specific,  what we did with the omic data is 
A) we transformed (after normalisation) the very high dimensional omic matrices into lower dimension space using deep-learning
B) we identified which new features were linked to survival using survival analysis approaches
C) post-processing (cluster...classification....)

So, to sum-up, the main step for the image project according to my opinion is to know if any kind of image features can be linked to survival.
A survival data is a time (like 180 days of following) and an event, used classically as a boolean (1 the patient died,or  0 he is still alive after 180 days).

Survival models such as Cox-PH will fit, according to a training dataset with survival data and cofactors (such as age, the presence of metastasis...) a survival curve telling you the probability to die after X days (at day 0: 100% probability of survival)

here, what I will do is I will try the power of new DL image algorithms (convolutional autoencoders,.image-net....,   there are so many) to transform the image data first into new spaces and see if, amongst the new features, there are some significantly linked to survival. 


We can talk tomorrow or this week


also Fred,

if it can help you, you can consult and play with lifelines, a user-friendly python package for processing and create survival models, to help you understand these concepts.

here is also a link toward a paper explaining a little bit more the Cox-PH model:

and in R you have a great and very fast survival library (and many other on the question):
